43.2
====
 - 43.2.0 43.2 Recommended Build.

43.1
====
 - 43.1.65 Allow discovering services from the mods folder that use java's modular definition. (#9143)
 - 43.1.64 Make Datapack Registries support ICondition(s) (#9113)
 - 43.1.63 Enable additional build types to handle pull request validation. (#9159)
 - 43.1.62 Check source permission level before selector permission (#9147)
           In some situations, such as execution of a function by an advancement as
           part of its reward, a command source stack may have a backing source of
           a ServerPlayer which may lack the entity selector permission and have an
           explicit permission level that should allow the use of entity selectors,
           through CommandSourceStack#withPermission.
           We now check if the permission level of the command source stack is
           sufficient for entity selectors _before_ checking if the source is a
           player and if they have the requisite permission.
           This means that an operator permission level of 2 will always override
           the Forge entity selector permission.

 - 43.1.50 Add HitResult to `EntityTeleportEvent$EnderPearl` (#9135)
 - 43.1.49 Throw aggregate exception for erroneous registry event dispatch (#9111)
           This means that exceptions occurring during the dispatch of the registry
           events, such as those from the suppliers of RegistryObjects, properly
           cause a crash rather than merely being logged and allowing the game to
           reach the main menu.

           Fixes #8994
 - 43.1.2  Hotfix for 1.19.2 item animation bug (#8987)

43.0
====
 - 43.0.22 Added ItemDecorator API (#8794)
 - 43.0.21 [1.19.x] Custom usage animations for items (#8932)
 - 43.0.20 Allow registering custom `ColorResolver`s (#8880)
 - 43.0.19 [1.19] Allow custom outline rendering on EntityRenderers and BlockEntityRenderers (#8938)
 - 43.0.18 Redirect checks for entity selector use to a permission (#8947)
           This allows greater flexibility for configuring servers with
           operator-like permissions to user groups through the permissions API and
           their permissions handler of choice without needing to grant the
           vanilla operator permission to any player.
           The new permission is "forge:use_entity_selectors", which is granted by
           default to players with permission level 2 (GAMEMASTERS) and above.
           The hook falls back to checking the permission level if the source of
           the command is not a ServerPlayer, such as for command blocks and
           functions.

 - 41.0.70  Handle modded packets on the network thread (#8703)
            * Handle modded packets on the network thread
             - On the server we simply need to remove the call to
               ensureRunningOnSameThread.
             - On the client side, we now handle the packet at the very start of the
               call. We make sure we're running from a network thread to prevent
               calling the handling code twice.
               While this does mean we no longer call .release(), in practice this
               doesn't cause any leaks as ClientboundCustomPayloadPacket releases
               for us.
            * Clarify behaviour a little in the documentation
            * Javadoc formatting
            * Add a helper method for handling packets on the main thread
            Also rename the network thread one. Should make it clearer the expected
            behaviour of the two, and make it clearer there's a potentially breaking
            change.
            * Add back consumer() methods
            Also document EventNetworkChannel, to clarify the thread behaviour
            there.
            * Add since = "1.19" to deprecated annotations

            * Revert "Allow safely registering RenderType predicates at any time (#8685)"
            This reverts commit be7275443fd939db9c58bcad47079c3767789ac1.
            * Renderable API refactors
            - Rename "render values" to "context"
            - Rename SimpleRenderable to CompositeRenderable to better reflect its use
            - Remove IMultipartRenderValues since it doesn't have any real use
            - Add extensive customization options to BakedModelRenderable
            * ClientRegistry and MinecraftForgeClient refactors
            - Add sprite loader manager and registration event
            - Add spectator shader manager and registration event
            - Add client tooltip factory manager and registration event
            - Add recipe book manager and registration event
            - Add key mapping registration event
            - Remove ClientRegistry, as everything has been moved out of it
            - Remove registration methods from MinecraftForgeClient, as they have dedicated events now
            * Dimension special effects refactors
            - Fold handlers into an extension class and remove public mutable fields
            - Add dimension special effects manager and registration event
            * HUD overlay refactors
            - Rename to IGuiOverlay match vanilla (instead of Ingame)
            - Add overlay manager and registration event
            - Move vanilla overlays to a standalone enum
            * Model loader refactors
            - Rename IModelLoader to IGeometryLoader
            - Add loader manager and registration event
            - Fold all model events into one
            - Move registration of additionally loaded models to an event
            - Remove ForgeModelBakery and related classes as they served no purpose anymore
            * Render properties refactors
            - Rename all render properties to client extensions and relocate accordingly
            - Move lookups to the respective interfaces
            * Model data refactors
            - Convert model data to a final class backed by an immutable map and document mutability requirements. This addresses several thread-safety issues in the current implementation which could result in race conditions
            - Transfer ownership of the data manager to the client level. This addresses several issues that arise when multiple levels are used at once
            * GUI and widget refactors
            - Move all widgets to the correct package
            - Rename GuiUtils and children to match vanilla naming
            * New vertex pipeline API
            - Move to vanilla's VertexConsumer
            - Roll back recent PR making VertexConsumer format-aware. This is the opposite of what vanilla does, and should not be relevant with the updated lighting pipeline
            * Lighting pipeline refactors
            - Move to dedicated lighting package
            - Separate flat and smooth lighters
            - Convert from a vertex pipeline transformer to a pure vertex source (input is baked quads)
            * Model geometry API refactors
            - Rename IModelGeometry to IUnbakedGeometry
            - Rename IModelConfiguration to IGeometryBakingContext
            - Rename other elements to match vanilla naming
            - Remove current changes to ModelState, as they do not belong there. Transforms should be specified through vanilla's system. ModelState is intended to transfer state from the blockstate JSON
            - Remove multipart geometries and geometry parts. After some discussion, these should not be exposed. Instead, geometries should be baked with only the necessary parts enabled
            * Make render types a first-class citizen in baked models
            - Add named render types (block + entity + fabulous entity)
            - Add named render type manager + registration event
            - Make BakedModel aware of render types and transfer control over which ones are used to it instead of ItemBlockRenderTypes (fallback)
            - (additional) Add concatenated list view. A wrapper for multiple lists that iterates through them in order without the cost of merging them. Useful for merging lists of baked quads
            * General event refactors
            - Several renames to either match vanilla or improve clarity
            - Relocate client chat event dispatching out of common code
            * Forge model type refactors
            - Rename SeparatePerspectiveModel to SeparateTransformsModel
            - Rename ItemModelMesherForge to ForgeItemModelShaper
            - Rename DynamicBucketModel to DynamicFluidContainerModel
            - Prefix all OBJ-related classes with "Obj" and decouple parsing from construction
            - Extract ElementsModel from model loader registry
            - Add EmptyModel (baked, unbaked and loader)
            - Refactor CompositeModel to take over ItemMultiLayerBakedModel
            - Remove FluidModel as it's not used and isn't compatible with the new fluid rendering in modern versions
            - Move model loader registration to a proper event handler
            - Update names of several JSON fields (backwards-compatible)
            - Update datagens to match
            * Miscellaneous changes and overlapping patches
            - Dispatch all new registration events
            - Convert ExtendedServerListData to a record
            - Add/remove hooks from ForgeHooksClient as necessary
            * Update test mods
            * Fix VertexConsumerWrapper returning parent instead of itself
            * Additional event cleanup pass
            As discussed on Discord:
            - Remove "@hidden" and "@see <callsite>" javadoc annotations from all client events and replace them with @ApiStatus.Internal annotation
            - Make all events that shouldn't be fired directly into abstract classes with protected constructors
            - Another styling pass, just in case (caught some missed classes)
            * Add proper deprecation javadocs and de-dupe some vertex consumer code
            * Replace sets of chunk render types with a faster BitSet-backed collection
            This largely addresses potential performance concerns that using a plain HashSet might involve by making lookups and iteration as linear as they can likely be (aside from using a plain byte/int/long for bit storage). Further performance concerns related to the implementation may be addressed separately, as all the implementation details are hidden from the end user
            * Requested changes
            - Remove MinecraftForgeClient and move members to Minecraft, IForgeMinecraft and StencilManager
            - Allow non-default elements to be passed into VertexConsumer and add support to derived classes
            - Move array instantiation out of quad processing in lighting pipeline
            - Fix flipped fluid container model
            - Set default UV1 to the correct values in the remapping pipeline
            - Minor documentation changes
            * Add/update EXC entries and fix AT comment
            * Add test mod as per Orion's request
            * Additional requested changes
            * Allow custom model types to request the particle texture to be loaded
            * Even more requested changes
            * Improve generics in ConcatenatedListView and add missing fallbacks
            * Fix fluid render types being bound to the fluid and not its holder
            * Remove non-contractual nullability in ChunkRenderTypeSet and add isEmpty
            Additionally, introduce chunk render type checks in ItemBlockRenderTypes

 - 41.0.38  Fix SP-Devtime world loading crash due to missing server configs (#8757)
 - 41.0.37  Remove ForgeWorldPreset and related code (#8756)
            Vanilla has a working replacement.
 - 41.0.36  Change ConfigValue#get() to throw if called before config loaded  (#8236)
            This prevents silent issues where a mod gets the value of the setting
            before configs are loaded, which means the default value is always
            returned.
            As there may be situations where the getting the config setting before
            configs are loaded is needed, and it is not preferable to hardcode the
            default value, the original behavior is made available through #getRaw.
            Implements and closes #7716
            * Remove getRaw() method
            This is effectively replaced with the expression `spec.isLoaded() ?
            configValue.get() : configValue.getDefault()`.
            * Remove forceSystemNanoTime config setting
            As implemented, it never had any effect as any place where the config
            value would be queried happens before the configs are loaded.

            required by Enum#valueOf, causing invalid suggestions (both in gui and
            through the error message).

            * Add package-infos to client events package
            * Rename SoundLoadEvent to SoundEngineLoadEvent
            This reduces confusion from consumers which may think the
            name SoundLoadEvent refers to an individual sound being loaded rather
            than the sound engine.
            * Document and change SoundLoadEvent to fire on mod bus
            Previously, it fired on both the mod bus and the Forge bus, which is
            confusing for consumers.
            * Delete SoundSetupEvent
            Looking at its original implementation shows that there isn't an
            appropriate place in the new sound code to reinsert the event, and the
            place of 'sound engine/manager initialization event' is taken already by SoundLoadEvent.
            * Perform some cleanup on client events
             - Removed nullable annotations from ClientPlayerNetworkEvent
             - Renamed #getPartialTicks methods to #getPartialTick, to be consistent
              with vanilla's naming of the partial tick
             - Cleanup documentation to remove line breaks, use the
              spelling 'cancelled' over
              'canceled', and improve docs on existing and
               new methods.
            * Remove EntityEvent.CanUpdate
            Closes MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge#6394
            * Switch to Jetbrains nullability annotations
            * New PlayLevelSoundEvent; replaces old PlaySoundAtEntityEvent
            * Remove ForgeWorldPresetScreens
            * Remove IForgeRegistryEntry
            * Remove use of List<Throwable> in FML's CompletableFutures
            * Add docs to mod loading stages, stages, and phases
            * Gradle 7.4.2
            * Use SLF4J in FMLLoader and other subprojects
            * Switch dynamic versions in subprojects to pinned ones
            * Switch ForgeRoot and MDK to FG plugin markers
            * Configure Forge javadoc task
            The task now uses a custom stylesheet with MCForge elements, and
            configured to combine the generation from the four FML subprojects
            (fmlloader, fmlcore, javafmllanguage, mclanguage) and the Forge project
            into the javadoc output.
            * Update docs/md files, for 1.19 update and the move away from IRC to Discord.
            * Make "Potentially dangerous alternative prefix" a debug warning, not info.
